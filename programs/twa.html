              In “TWA: Total Work of Art,” we invite artists, designers, writers, programmers, and anyone else interested to shapeshift their concept across three modalities: 1) digital, 2) physical, and 3) temporal. Inspired by wide-ranging examples of design as world-building — think Bauhaus, Beyoncé, Bernadette Corporation — this workshop responds to how culture is experienced today, inviting participants to develop a core concept across multiple forms and points of access.</p><p>
              This 7 week workshop is led by three teachers: Stephen Kwok, Laurel Schwulst, and Bryant Wells. Meeting twice a week (on Thursdays and Sundays), each session includes conversational lectures, technical demonstrations, presentation and critique time, and guest visits. The workshop culminates in a public event in which the participants present the totality of their work.

            Laurel asks: How do I include the TWA icon on this page? On the homepage? Should there be some kind of rainbow associated with this class? Like our <a href="https://twa-fruitful-2025.glitch.me/">original sketch</a>?
