            Hi everyone,
          </p></p>
We‚Äôre excited to launch our class ‚ÄúTWA‚Äù which stands for ‚ÄúTotal Work of Art‚Äù ‚Äî
</p></p>
In ‚ÄúTWA: Total Work of Art,‚Äù we invite artists, designers, writers, programmers, and anyone else interested to shapeshift their concept across three modalities: 1) digital, 2) physical, and 3) temporal. Inspired by wide-ranging examples of design as world-building ‚Äî think Bauhaus, Beyonc√©, Bernadette Corporation ‚Äî this workshop responds to how culture is experienced today, inviting participants to develop a core concept across multiple forms and points of access.
This 7 week workshop is led by us, three teachers: Stephen Kwok, Laurel Schwulst, and Bryant Wells. Meeting twice a week (on Thursdays and Sundays), each session includes conversational lectures, technical demonstrations, presentation and critique time, and guest visits. The workshop culminates in a public event in which the participants present the totality of their work.
We‚Äôre launching the class under ‚ÄúUltralight School,‚Äù a new educational umbrella, beginning this summer. It‚Äôs a natural continuation of Laurel‚Äôs previous ‚ÄúFruitful School‚Äù with much of the same ethos but with a new summertime levity üçÉ
We invite you to apply to TWA here. Applications are due 11:59pm EST on May 21, 2025.
</p></p>
Feel free to email us twa@ultralight.school if you have any questions.
</p></p>
Looking forward to seeing you this summer!
</p></p>
Stephen Kwok, Laurel Schwulst, & Bryant Wells
